Software Development 4

Hand Out Date: Monday 5th February

Hand In Date: Monday 5th March 

This assignment must be completed in teams of two people.

Please register your team on the CA1 forum page on Moodle.

You are required to develop a website using the Java Play Framework. This website should incorporate both client and server side functionality for the management of employees in a company, the projects they work on and the department they work in. 

The following are the minimum set of mappings required in the system:

•	Employee – Address (One To One mapping)

•	Employee – Project (Many To Many mapping) 

•	Employee – Department (One To Many mapping)


The system should also cater for different types of users where at least one of the user types should be able to log in and access parts of the website not accessible by other users. For example, a manager can update the projects that an employee works on but the employee can only view their projects – no update/deletes allowed. This is just one example of different levels of access, you must decide on the different user types that your system will cater for.
